- `-`: bounce back and forth between two directories
	- `gco -` even can change between Git branches
- `pwd`: Print Working Directory
<!-- more -->
- `ls`: List
- `cd`: Change Directory
- `cd ..`: change to the parent directory
	- can add alias `..` or `...`

## Other Command
- `⌃ + L`: clear (while terminal is idle)
- `⌃ + K`: clear (even while the shell is busy)
- `&&`: Chaining commands
